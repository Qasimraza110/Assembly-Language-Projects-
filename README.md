# Assembly-Language-Projects-
This repository includes two Assembly Language projects: a Digital Clock and a Monochromatic Alphabetical System. The digital clock shows real-time in HH:MM:SS format using BIOS/DOS interrupts, while the alphabetical system displays English alphabets in a single-color format through direct video memory access
